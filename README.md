# Bounce-Framework

Bounce Framework is an platformer framework for Godot to create platformer games easily without having to code all the movement, enemies, etc. Bounce Framework has it all right there!
You can customize velocity, change assets, edit bosses, you can do it all!

Note: Bounce Framework is in early-stage right now. I'm still making this so there might be bugs.
